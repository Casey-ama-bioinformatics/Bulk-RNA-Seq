# Bulk RNA Seq Workflow  
Casey Ho  
## Introduction
This page documents the basic workflow for bulk RNA sequencing data analysis. This is written in parallel with data processing for Book 50-10 Bulk RNA-Seq Data using Windows Command Prompt (Windows 11 Home License) with Hyper-v configuration and RStudio. 
## Directory

## 1. Fastq files 
The fastq files are uncompressed using `7zip` and organized into `Fastqfiles` folder. 

## 2. Running FastQC on fastq files
Running FastQC analysis prior to trimming allows us to visualise sequencing metrics
