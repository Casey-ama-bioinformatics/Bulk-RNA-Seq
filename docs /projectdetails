This project aims to identify differentially expressed genes in PVA cells vs Whole blood under Lean vs High fat diet (HFD) conditions. The cells of interest should be neutrophils and other immune cells. Early neutrophils should be recruited to injured PVA cells in normal (lean) mouse but not in diabetic (HFD) mouse models.
Hypothesis: Diabetic conditions modeled by hfd mouse changes the gene expression in the migration of immune cells. 
Experimental design: 16 samples in total (4 male hfd blood, 4 male hfd pva, 4 male lean blood, 4 male lean pva)
